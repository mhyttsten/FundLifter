A. Document GridMaze environment


B. Tutorials
------------
1. Dynamic programming
  4x4 maze G at [0,0] and [3,3], R=-1 on all transitions
    (will qtable converge or does R=0 or 1 on Gs?)
  Bounce off walls
  Hardcode transtion probabilities (0.25)

2. Dynamic programming
  Variant of Frozen Lake
  Deal with variational probabilities
  I.e. avoid going to a cell, you get bounced back 2 w prob=0.5
  
[We've know talked about Model-based environment]
[Let's not talk about model-free environments]
  
3. TD(0) with exploration
Have walls

4. MC TTT
