FL: Take away annoying date thing after "Main" and each Portfolio. Put in on top of main somewhere
FL: Put stats on top funds (total funds / considered / discarded)
FL: Put title on "Top Funds"

FL: How do you populate 'All Categories' in Main
FL: "Top Funds" within All Categories naturally crashes
FL: Firebase SSL problems

FL: Fix log, and allow for a log display window
FL: Store (and fetch) portfolio file from GCS
FL: Fix date update after you've done a DB update
Increase emacs font size
Move code from open_spiel_yourstuff
AllAboutSwift: GitHub & XCode, make Firebase and open_spiel play together
FL: Secure your GCP cloud (Clean up Firebase storage bucket, and delete Firebase Database content)
    Add authentication and restrict access to Firebase Storage bucket
FL: The pos stepper can go below/above thresholds but as noops, how can you avoid that

Questions:
- In UpdateDBModalView: Why aren't we forced to do .message="..." from main thread?
  (as in AppDataObservable)
- In UpdateDBModalView I cannot update the view when executing from onAppear
  I need to do the HTTP request and UI element update in init() of the Observable
  However I am able to update in AppDataObservable.initialize when called from onAppear
  Difference is that I do all work on a global GCD queue (whereas the DBUpdate executes from a Firebase Storage thread)
