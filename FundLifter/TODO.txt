Create your spreadsheet with funds and indexes

TopFunds: Click on index to see funds (add destination view when clicked)
   Fund list needs to be prefixed by type
TopFunds: Go lower than 1w --> sort by Morningstar stars for fund lists, sort by #funds for index lists
TopFunds: Move Y2D to right hand of ranking, let name take up as much space as possible
   Maybe lower text size if exceeds x characters?

Post-release Fixes
FL: Add fund click on TopFunds list -> gives graph + fund data
FL: Remove normal fund view, now that everyone uses 'Top Fund' view
FL: Fix log, and allow for a log display window
FL: Fix date update after you've done a DB update
FL: "Top Funds" within All Categories naturally crashes
Increase emacs font size
Move code from open_spiel_yourstuff
AllAboutSwift: GitHub & XCode, make Firebase and open_spiel play together
FL: Secure your GCP cloud (Clean up Firebase storage bucket, and delete Firebase Database content)
    Add authentication and restrict access to Firebase Storage bucket
FL: The pos stepper can go below/above thresholds but as noops, how can you avoid that
FL: Extract Phase. Replace 'postProcessing', 'ignore...' with just a 'debug' + list of explicit funds to extract
    Remove weird HTTP parameters in Cron...java class
    Create service to remove 'Attempted today' and any 'DPD' recorded for current Friday so you can force an extract

Questions:
- In UpdateDBModalView: Why aren't we forced to do .message="..." from main thread?
  (as in AppDataObservable)
- In UpdateDBModalView I cannot update the view when executing from onAppear
  I need to do the HTTP request and UI element update in init() of the Observable
  However I am able to update in AppDataObservable.initialize when called from onAppear
  Difference is that I do all work on a global GCD queue (whereas the DBUpdate executes from a Firebase Storage thread)
