Update MainView FundDB time after modal dialog box has been dismissed
  

Questions:
- In UpdateDBModalView: Why aren't we forced to do .message="..." from main thread?
  (as in AppDataObservable)
- In UpdateDBModalView I cannot update the view when executing from onAppear
  I need to do the HTTP request and UI element update in init() of the Observable
  However I am able to update in AppDataObservable.initialize when called from onAppear
  Difference is that I do all work on a global GCD queue (whereas the DBUpdate executes from a Firebase Storage thread)
