Clean up Firebase storage bucket, and delete Firebase Database content
Add authentication and restrict access to Firebase Storage bucket

Update MainView FundDB time after modal dialog box has been dismissed
  

Questions:
- In UpdateDBModalView: Why aren't we forced to do .message="..." from main thread?
  (as in AppDataObservable)
- In UpdateDBModalView I cannot update the view when executing from onAppear
  I need to do the HTTP request and UI element update in init() of the Observable
  However I am able to update in AppDataObservable.initialize when called from onAppear
  Difference is that I do all work on a global GCD queue (whereas the DBUpdate executes from a Firebase Storage thread)
