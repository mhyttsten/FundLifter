FL: Can you use RowView2 for portfolio also (and update portfolio displays update?)
    If so, can you retire the HM key thing?
FL: You also want to have pos window for Portfolio - at least "All Categories"

FL: Fix date update after you've done a DB update
Increase emacs font size
Move code from open_spiel_yourstuff
AllAboutSwift: GitHub & XCode, make Firebase and open_spiel play together
Install latest TensorFlow Swift release

Clean up Firebase storage bucket, and delete Firebase Database content
Add authentication and restrict access to Firebase Storage bucket

Update MainView FundDB time after modal dialog box has been dismissed

Questions:
- In UpdateDBModalView: Why aren't we forced to do .message="..." from main thread?
  (as in AppDataObservable)
- In UpdateDBModalView I cannot update the view when executing from onAppear
  I need to do the HTTP request and UI element update in init() of the Observable
  However I am able to update in AppDataObservable.initialize when called from onAppear
  Difference is that I do all work on a global GCD queue (whereas the DBUpdate executes from a Firebase Storage thread)
